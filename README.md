# Checkers  
Desktop application for playing checkers with a bot / friend in C++.  
Using the SDL2 framework for rendering.  
Supports the game bot vs bot with the setting of the depth of calculation for each separately (from settings.json).  
## For developers:  
To work install SDL2 and SDL2_image(Board.h, Hand.h), nlohmann/json(Config.h) and correct path strings in Board.h and Config.h.
The calculation is made for the number of steps equal to depth + 1, where, for example, steps with multiple takes are counted as 1 step.  
State traversal uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning heuristics.  
To calculate values in leaf states, the Logic::calc_score function is used.  
You can set your params in settings.json:  
### WindowSize
Width - unsigned int from 0 to screen size. 0 - fullscreen.  
Height - unsigned int from 0 to screen size. 0 - fullscreen.  
### Bot
IsWhiteBot - true/false.  
IsBlackBot - true/false.  
WhiteBotLevel - unsigned int. If "IsWhiteBot" is set true then the depth of calculation will be "WhiteBotLevel" + 1. (0 - 2 is eazy, 3 - 5 medium, 6 - 12 is hard. 6+ levels can be slow without "Optimization").   
BlackBotLevel - unsigned int. If "IsBlackBot" is set true then the depth of calculation will be "BlackBotLevel" + 1.  
BotScoringType - "NumberOnly" (the bot takes into account only the number of checkers)  or "NumberAndPotential" (the bot also takes into account the positions of checkers).  
BotDelayMS - unsigned int. Minimum delay per bot move.  
NoRandom - true/false. Whether the bot will be deterministic.  
Optimization - "O0"/"O1"/"O2". They provide significant optimization in terms of the time of the bot's progress. O0 disables optimization (max level 7), O1 allows you to cut off the worst branches of the search (max level 12), O2(temporarily unavailable) is much faster, but it can affect the choice of the move.  
### Game
MaxNumTurns - unsigned int. Maximum number of turns before draw.
